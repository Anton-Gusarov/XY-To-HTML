<!--
To see growing call doPushdown(60<or any number in px to grow>). Black components are growing.

What this demo application does is described in this section. It emulates HTML behaviour whenever any of the components (boxes) are growing vertically.
What does it mean. The current page if viewed in browser displays these components and this set resembles an arbitrary landing page.
This data is taken from real page but simplified. Black boxes are growing. In the same time we see boxes fully contained inside bigger ones.
From HTML perspective the bigger boxes are containers. So that these containers and below boxes must go down according
to like it is in HTML. After growing the landing page must remain its layout, look and design.
In order to produce HTML from absolute positioned boxes like it is
in data.js I wrote functions.js where the absolute boxes are transformed to a data structure which is a grid the cells
of which contain a single box. And because we can have a flat and strict structure, then we produce HTML. The function
getRowsAndCols makes such structure. The rendered HTML will be supplied later.

The code calculates new positions of elements relying on HTML data structure and renders boxes absolute positioned with
new coordinates and dimensions.

<p>
    On the left - absolute positioned elements, Right - HTML produced page. These elements are from data.js and processed
    through getRowsAndCols in order to get grid data structure necessary for HTML rendering. Also a valuable feature
    can be observed by calling doPushdown(60&laquo;or any number in px to grow&raquo;) from dev console.
    Black components are growing
    and pushing below components according to the html rendering data structure. It happens in left side - absolute positioned.
    In doPushdown there is no any dependency on DOM.
